# Oil Reservoir Prediction using Machine Learning

This project predicts the **presence of oil reservoirs** using geological and trap features.  
It applies **data preprocessing, class balancing (SMOTE), and machine learning models** such as **Random Forest** and **XGBoost** to achieve accurate predictions.

## Features
- Handles missing values and categorical variables with encoding  
- Balances imbalanced dataset using **SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling)**  
- Trains and compares **Random Forest** and **XGBoost** classifiers  
- Evaluates models with **Classification Report** and **ROC-AUC**
